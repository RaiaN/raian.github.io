Imagine the following situation in Unreal Engine 4 gameplay code:

```cpp
APlayer::OnAttacked()
{
    USoundSystem* SoundSystem = GameInstance->GetSoundSystem();
    if (IsValid(SoundSystem))
    {
        SoundSystem->PlaySoundCue(OnAttackedSoundCue);
    }
}
```

**SoundSystem** can be invalid but what does that mean? Is it OK situation to just use _IsValid()_ and do nothing otherwise? This issue is more interesting that it seems.

Good question to start with is if **SoundSystem** is not valid in _OnAttacked()_ context then maybe we should tell someone about it? To do that one can use multiple methods: return values, delegates calling, writing some error message to log... but wait! **SoundSystem** is not valid!

When a game system is not valid then what do we can to do? Well, let's get an instance of that system because it should be created already, right?

```cpp
APlayer::OnAttacked()
{
    USoundSystem* SoundSystem = nullptr;
    if (!IsValid(SoundSystem))
    {
        SoundSystem = GameInstance->GetSoundSystem();
    }

    SoundSystem->PlaySoundCue(OnAttackedSoundCue);
}
```

But should we use _IsValid()_ again just to be sure SoundSystem we've got is valid? It seems like we are going to have a infinite loop here.

Another way to fix this problem is to put SoundSystem initialization into _APlayer_ method that can guarantee _SoundSystem_ is initialized:

```cpp

// .h
class APlayer : AActor
{
    ...
private:
    UPROPERTY()
    USoundSystem* SoundSystem;
};


// .cpp
APlayer::APlayer()
{
    SoundSystem = nullptr;
}

APlayer::PostSoundSystemInitialize()
{
    SoundSystem = GameInstance->GetSoundSystem();
}

APlayer::OnAttacked()
{
    if (IsValid(SoundSystem))
    {
        SoundSystem->PlaySoundCue(OnAttackedSoundCue);
    }
}
```

Notice that we fixed our issue with checking SoundSystem pointer in _OnAttacked()_ method but still don't know what to do if it is somehow invalid.

Additional question is what if we don't want to store _SoundSystem_ pointer in _APlayer_? Imagine one has _AEnemy_, _AEnemyTank_, _AEnemyTower_ instead of only APlayer and all those classes have to have ability to play sound cue.

I think good solution is to divide all pointer checks into "soft" and "hard" ones. Soft check is when a program can continue execution. Hard one is when we tell a program to stop the execution.

In our case we need "hard" check of _SoundSystem_ pointer because otherwise that means something is totally wrong with game systems initialization process.

How to do "hard" checks in Unreal Engine 4 C++? There are many ways according to official [documentation](https://www.google.comhttps://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming):

```cpp
* check
* checkf
* verify
* verifyf
* checkSlow
* checkfSlow
* verifySlow
```

Any of above macroses will halt the execution of the program and that is exactly what we need!

Result:

```cpp
APlayer::OnAttacked()
{
    USoundSystem* SoundSystem = GameInstance->GetSoundSystem();
    check(SoundSystem); // or check(IsValid(SoundSystem))

    SoundSystem->PlaySoundCue(OnAttackedSoundCue);
}
```

As a conclusion I will also say that default engine macroses _checkSlow_, _checkfSlow_, _verifySlow_ are especially good if you need to check a pointer only in a debug version of your code.
